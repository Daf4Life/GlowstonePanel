This is a free Minecraft Server Hosting Control Panel. Don't want to buy Multicraft? Bored of other free panels? Then try this!

## FEATURES
- Very intuitive panel
- Free, open-source and continually updated
- Enable/Disable the registration form
- Every account gets a Minecraft Server
- Working with the powerful tech of NodeJS and Bootstrap

I would like to get some feedback, [so you can tell me in the Spigot thread your opinion and suggestions. I read all ;)](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/glowstone-panel.227618/)

## HOW TO INSTALL?
1 - You need NodeJS installed and a MySQL database
2 - Download the panel
3 - Run install.bat and wait until it finishes installing some dependencies
4 - Import the sql.sql file in your MySQL database
5 - Open config.json and edit it as you want
6 - Put the jar file of the server you prefer in the root folder. That jar has to be named server.jar and it will be used to create all the servers
7 - Open run.bat and start using your panel! Be sure that you aren't running anything more in the port number 80.
